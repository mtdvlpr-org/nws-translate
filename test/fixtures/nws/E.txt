about: About
about1: New World Scheduler was created to help simplify and unify the scheduling and organising by appointed brothers in the congregation. Whether you are serving as an elder or ministerial servant, the Coordinator of the Body of Elders, Secretary, or have any other responsibility, we hope that New World Scheduler makes your work easier and quicker. That way we can all spend more time with our families, preaching, teaching and shepherding!
about2: NWS is maintained by a small team of brothers and sisters based in Australia. Our team are all currently in full-time service, and all brothers are elders. Between us we have spent over 45 years in the full-time service, including more than 10 years in special full-time service. Our team members have also served at branch offices, remote translation offices and in many lands where the need is greater.
aboutNote: Please Note: While all team members are active Jehovah’s Witnesses, we are not affiliated with JW.org or the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society. This program does not replace any official program or website, does not contain any ‘spiritual food’ and does not gather personal data. All data inside this program comes from your local body of elders only.
